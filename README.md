**Showroom Management System**

This project is a simple yet comprehensive Showroom Management System implemented in Java. It provides an interactive command-line interface for managing 
automotive showrooms, employees, and cars.

**Key Features:**
- Add new showrooms, employees, and cars with details such as name, address, ID, age, department, color, fuel type, price, car type, and transmission.
- Display all showrooms, employees, and cars with their respective details.
- Update existing showroom, employee, and car records.
- Delete showrooms, employees, and cars based on their names or IDs.
- Search for showrooms, employees, and cars by their names or IDs.
- Display total cars in stock for each showroom.
- Display employees working in a specific showroom.

**Enhancements:**
1. The project now includes proper exception handling and input validation to prevent unexpected behavior or crashes due to incorrect input.
2. Dynamic data structures have been implemented to handle a variable number of showrooms, employees, and cars, replacing the fixed-size arrays.
3. Additional functionalities for updating and deleting existing records have been added to enhance the system's flexibility and utility.
4. The main method and menu functionalities have been organized into a separate class, `ShowroomManagementSystem`, for better code organization and maintainability.

This Showroom Management System offers an efficient and user-friendly way to manage the various aspects of an automotive showroom. 
As you continue to develop and enhance this project, it has the potential to become a more robust and versatile application, serving 
as a valuable tool for showroom administrators and employees alike.

Feel free to contribute to this project and further expand its capabilities to meet your specific needs or use it as a basis for
other management system applications. Happy coding!
